Python3: About Classes
---

Todo (always say why):
- property (why is it useful: compatibility, readability, attribute inheritance that becomes dynamic)
- public, private, protected
- multi inheritance (order, how to manage it)
- Special method `__new__` (exple: count instances)
- class attribute inheritance (bounding)
- metaclass (solve cls_attr bounding for instance)
